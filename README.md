Note: I have tested this with Python 3.10, but will probably also work with older versions.

to install the necessary python dependencies:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/glhr/hummingbird.git
```

then to run the benchmark:
```
python3 run.py
```

if there are any issues running the code, let me know :)
